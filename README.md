# Fork from https://github.com/jonnius/gnome-system-menu

! Only tested on Ubuntu 18.04 !

This is a fork to support Gnome 3.28, I thought it would be appreciated by some people.

Follow the Manual Instructions below to install it on your computer.

# System Menu

System Menu is a GNOME Shell extension that creates a menu on the top panel, containing useful shortcuts. You can install it via [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1204/system-menu/).

## Manual Installation
- (Optionnal but recommended) Uninstall gnome-system-menu if you have installed it from the Gnome Software Center
- Clone this repo (or download and unzip it)
- Run install.sh inside the directory
- Restart the GNOME Shell and enable the extension using the GNOME Tweak Tool (disconnect from your session)
